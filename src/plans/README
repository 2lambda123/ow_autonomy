This directory contains PLEXIL plans that implement the onboard
autonomy for the Ocean World lander.

The top level plan is OceanWorldMission.plp, which implements the Sol 0
activities as described in project documentation.

There are two ways to build this directory.

1. As part of the OceanWATERS ROS application.  From the 'src' subdirectory of
   your workspace, enter 'catkin build'.

   
2. Standalone, in any Unix environment.

a) To compile the plans, type 'make'.  This generates .ple files from the .plp,
and .plx from the .ple.  The .plx files are executed by the PLEXIL executive.

b) To remove all build products, 'make clean'.

c) To run the plan, there is a convenient command, 'make run'.  The cousin
directory 'plexil-adapter' must first be built.
