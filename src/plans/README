This directory contains PLEXIL plans that implement the onboard
autonomy for the Ocean World lander.  See the parent directory's
README for context and prerequisites.

The top level plan is OceanWorldMission.plp, which implements the Sol 0
activities as described in project documentation (to be cited).

To compile the plans, type 'make'.  This generates .ple files from the .plp, and
.plx from the .ple.  The .plx files are executed by the PLEXIL executive.

To remove all build products, 'make clean'.

To run the plan, there is a convenient command, 'make run'.  The sister
directory 'plexil-adapter' must first be built.
