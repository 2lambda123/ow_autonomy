PLEXIL plans
============
This directory contains PLEXIL plans that implement onboard autonomy for Ocean
World landers, as supported by the OceanWATERS software testbed.

In particular, EuropaMission.plp implements the Europa Reference Mission as
described in project documentation.

Note that Checkpoints are saved to ~/.ros by default, specified in ow-config.xml

See ow_autonomy/README.md for build instructions.
