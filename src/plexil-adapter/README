This directory contains C++ classes and code implementing the interface between
the PLEXIL plans (found in ../plans) and the external world (lander,
environment).

TEMPORARILY (noted 6/6/19) it also contains the implementation of a ROS node for
the ow_autonomy package: autonomy.cpp.  This directory will be refactored.

See ow_autonomy/README for build instructions.
