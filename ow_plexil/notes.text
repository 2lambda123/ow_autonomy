To Do
-----

See that pan/tilt joint telemetry is supported and tested.



Code Refactoring
----------------

Obsolete joint-support.h, or use its structures?

Subscribe by iterating over pairs of topic names and callback
functions.

Condense the 4 arm joint telemetry handling sets of repeated code.

Replace single-use functions with lambdas.


Code Cleanup
------------

Order things consistently.
