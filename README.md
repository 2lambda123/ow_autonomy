ow_autonomy
===========

This package contains a candidate onboard autonomy component for an Ocean
Worlds lander, namely a ROS node embedding a PLEXIL application.

It's called the `autonomy node`, and only one instance of this node in an
OceanWATERS application/mission is envisioned at this time.


Contents
--------

src/plans directory contains the PLEXIL plans.

src/plexil-adapter contains the supporting code needed to run them, and also the
ROS node implementation (for now).

See the README files in each subdirectory for more information.


Build
-----

A prerequisite for building and running this application is a working PLEXIL
installation, which has its own prerequisites.  For instructions see the
"Development Environment" Confluence page. The environment variable PLEXIL_HOME
must be set to PLEXIL's installation pathname.

Your ROS environment should also first be set up:

```bash
 source <catkin-workspace>/devel/setup.sh
```

Assumed is this directory filed properly within an OceanWATERS ROS workspace
(see Conftluence for instructions).  Build the entire workspace with:

```bash
 catkin build
```

Build just the ow_autonomy package with:

```bash
 catkin build ow_autonomy
```

NOTE: If any new PLEXIL plans (.plp or .ple files) have been added since your
last build, a clean rebuild of ow_autonomy is needed.  See bottom of this file
for instructions.


Run
---

1. Start the simulator:

```bash
  roslaunch ow europa_test_dem.launch arm_sim_enable:=true
```
   NOTES:
    - for faster performance, add `gzclient:=false`
    - for better terrain, use `europa_terminator.launch`

2. (optional, as needed) Start rqt for visualization and monitoring.

   `rqt`

   If you wish to view camera images:

   a) Select `Plugins/Visualization/Image View`
	 b) In the topic pulldown menu, select `/StereoCamera/left/image_raw`

   Note that `/StereoCamera/left/image_raw_mouse_left` appears in the box below.

3. Start the autonomy node.  To use the default plan:

   `roslaunch ow_autonomy autonomy_node.launch`

   This invocation loads the default PLEXIL plan, Demo.plx, which demonstrates a
   variety of lander functions: arm planning, guarded move, and panoramic
   imaging.  It is equivalent to:

   `roslaunch ow_autonomy autonomy_node.launch plan:=Demo.plx`

   Alternatively, you may specify a plan to load, by setting the 'plan' argument
   to a .plx file found in:

   `<ow_workspace>/devel/etc/plexil`


Plans
-----

Here are some interesting autonomy plans.  Run them as shown, substituting for
`Foo.plx`:

  `roslaunch ow_autonomy autonomy_node.launch plan:=Foo.plx`

1. A Europa reference mission Sol 0 prototype: `ReferenceMission1.plx`

2. A short panoramic imaging demo: `TestAntennaCamera.plx`

   A small area is imaged, with an iteration of tilts and pans.  To try other
   regions, edit `ow_autonomy/src/plans/TestAntennaCamera.plp` and enter

   `catkin build ow_autonomy`

   before restarting the autonomy node.  You don't need to restart the simulator.

3. Overtorque detection: `TorqueTest.plx`

   This plan attempts to push the scoop into the ground, which creates joint
   over-torquing warnings and errors.

4. Concurrency demo: `TestPlanning.plx`

   This runs the arm planning ROS service, while concurrently printing an "in
   progress" message.  This was not possible before service calls were threaded.

5. ROS Action demo: `TestActions.plx`

   This runs a dummy GuardedMove action (not connected to simulator)
   concurrently with the real GuardedMove service.
   
6. Demonstration of checkpointed plans: `EuropaMission.plx`


Fault Detection
---------------

A rudimentary version does nothing more than check relevant fault parameters for
each lander operation.  Run any plan you like, while setting fault parameters as
desired (see `ow_faults/README.md` for instructions).  Faults are reported as
ROS warnings.


Clean
-----

To clean (remove all build products from) just the ow_autonomy package:

 `cd <ow_workspace>/build`
 `rm -rf ow_autonomy`

To clean the entire ROS workspace (not needed if you're just rebuilding
ow_autonomy):

  `catkin clean`
