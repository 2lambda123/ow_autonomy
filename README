This directory contains a candidate onboard autonomy component for the Ocean
Worlds lander, namely a PLEXIL application.

The 'src/plans' directory contains the PLEXIL plans.
src/plexil-adapter contains the supporting code needed to run them.

See the README files in each subdirectory for more information.


Build
-----

A prerequisite for building and running this application is a working PLEXIL
installation (which has its own prerequisites).  for
instructions.  The evironment variable PLEXIL_HOME should be set to PLEXIL's
installation pathname.

There are two ways to build this system.

1. ROS build.  In the parent of this directory, type 'catkin build'.  Normally,
this would be all that's needed, but currently one manual step is needed.  Copy
<workspace>/src/plans/ow-config.xml to <workspace>/build/ow_autonomy/src/plans.

2. Standalone build.  cd to each of src/plexil-adapter and src/plans and type
'make'.


Run
---

At the moment this Plexil application is standalone (regardless of how built)
in the sense that it does not interface with anything external.

 % cd <workspace>/build/ow_autonomy/src/plans
 % plexilexec -p OceanWorldMission.plx -c ow-config.xml

The second command can be run with:

 % make run
