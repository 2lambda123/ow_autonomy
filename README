This directory contains a candidate onboard autonomy component for the Ocean
Worlds lander, namely a PLEXIL application.

The 'plans' directory contains the PLEXIL plans.
The 'plexil-adapter' directory contains the supporting code needed to run them.
See the README files in each subdirectory for more information.

This application has been tested in MacOS, and should work on any operating
system where PLEXIL is supported, which is most modern Unix-based environments.
The main prerequisite is a working PLEXIL installation (which has its own
prerequisites).  See plexil.sourceforge.net for information.

To run the top level plan:

1. Build each subdirectory, in any order, by typing 'make' in the directory.
2. cd plans
3. make run
