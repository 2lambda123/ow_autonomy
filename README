This directory contains a candidate onboard autonomy component for the Ocean
Worlds lander, namely a ROS node embedding a PLEXIL application.

Contents
--------

src/plans directory contains the PLEXIL plans.

src/plexil-adapter contains the supporting code needed to run them, and also the
ROS node implementation (for now).

See the README files in each subdirectory for more information.


Build
-----

% catkin build

A prerequisite for building and running this application is a working PLEXIL
installation (which has its own prerequisites).  For instructions see the
"Development Environment" Confluence page. The environment variable PLEXIL_HOME
must be set to PLEXIL's installation pathname.

Your ROS environment should also first be set up:
  source <catkin-workspace>/devel/setup.sh

Run
---

% roslaunch ow_autonomy autonomy_node.launch

At the moment, the node does nothing.  (A service-calling proof of concept demo
that previously ran has been removed).

You can also run the standalone Sol 0 PLEXIL plan outside of ROS:

 % cd <catkin-workspace>/devel/etc/plexil
 % plexilexec -p OceanWorldMission.plx -c ow-config.xml

Activities (which are stubs) should get printed, ending with:

  Plan complete, Exec exited without errors
