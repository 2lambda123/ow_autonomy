This directory contains a candidate onboard autonomy component for the Ocean
Worlds lander, namely a PLEXIL application.

The 'src/plans' directory contains the PLEXIL plans.
src/plexil-adapter contains the supporting code needed to run them.

See the README files in each subdirectory for more information.

The main prerequisite for building and running this application is a working
PLEXIL installation (which has its own prerequisites).  See
plexil.sourceforge.net for instructions.  The evironment variable PLEXIL_HOME
should be set to PLEXIL's installation pathname.
