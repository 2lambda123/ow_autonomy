This directory PLEXIL plans that implement the onboard autonomy for the
prototypical Ocean World lander.

At the moment, the top level plan is OceanWorldsMission.plp, which implements
the Sol 0 activities as described in project documentation (to be cited).

The plans must be compiled.  To do so, type 'make'.  This generates .ple files
from the .plp, and .plx from the .ple.  The .plx files are executed by the
PLEXIL executive.
